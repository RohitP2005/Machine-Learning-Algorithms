# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms written from scratch. Each algorithm has its own folder, which includes both a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) and a Python script (`.py`). Additionally, each folder contains a project demonstrating the practical application of the respective algorithm.

## Algorithms Included
